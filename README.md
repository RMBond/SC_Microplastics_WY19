## General Goals

Microplastics (MP; plastic particles \< 5 mm in diameter) are a growing
environmental concern which threatens the health of aquatic ecosystems
worldwide. Recent research has documented the ubiquitous nature of MP in
the marine environment and the assimilation of MP in fishes at all
trophic levels. Comparatively little is known, however, about the
occurrence and concentration of MP in riverine ecosystems. The project
goal is to determine if MP is present in the Scott Creek basin. Our
methods include sampling suspended MP in the water column and
documenting the occurrence of MP in the stomachs of juvenile steelhead
*(Oncorhynchus mykiss)*. This project is an important first step in
identifying the presence of MP in coastal watersheds and is a starting
point for assessing potential impacts on riverine fishes.
